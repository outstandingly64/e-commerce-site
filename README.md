# ComfySloth Furniture E-Commerce

An e-commerce demo platform for fictional furniture company Comfy Sloth. Check it out [here](https://slothfurniture.netlify.app).

## Description
The platform is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and CSS-in-JS with styled-components, a library for styling React components. The contact form is managed by Formspree, a service for handling contact forms, and Stripe is used as the payment gateway. The API data and overall state management of the site is handled by React's useContext and reducers, allowing for easy filtering and sorting of products based on user preferences. The site is deployed on Netlify, a platform for deploying and hosting web projects, and utilizes Netlify functions, a serverless computing service for hosting custom back-end logic which is used to implement the demo Stripe payment gateway.
